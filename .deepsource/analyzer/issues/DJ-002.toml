Consider using the `latest` or `earliest` method if you want to fetch the latest element from an ordered queryset.

So, instead of
```python
Entry.objects.order_by('pub_date')[0]
```

You can use the above mentioned methods, which are more straightforward:
```python
Entry.objects.latest('pub_date')
```
